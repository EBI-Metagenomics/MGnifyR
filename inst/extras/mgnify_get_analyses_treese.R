#' Retrieve OTU tables for all specified accessions and build a\code{TreeSummarizedExperiment} object
#'
#' \code{mgnify_get_analyses_treese} retrieves all associated Study, Sample and Analysis metadata attributes,
#' along with all OTU tables (of a given taxonomic type), and merges them together to build a \code{TreeSummarizedExperiment}
#' object with \code{otu_table}, \code{tax_table} and \code{sample_data} objects.
#' #'
#' @param client \code{mgnify_client} instance
#' @param accessions Single value or list/vector of Analysis accessions to retrieve data for.
#' @param usecache Whether to use the disk based cache.
#' @param returnLists Flag to determine whether to merge a per-analysis \code{TreeSummarizedExperiment} objects into one, or
#' return a list of single-sample objects. Since perculiarities in OTU format may lead to failed merges, returning
#' a list of single objects may aid debugging. In most cases though the desired behaviour is to return a single
#' object (returnLists = F)
#' @param tax_SU Which taxa subunit results should be selected? Currently, taxonomy assignments in the
#' MGnify pipelines rely on rRNA matches to existing databases (GreenGenes and SILVA), with later
#' pipelines checking both the SSU and LSU portions of the rRNA sequence. \code{tax_SU} allows the
#' selection of either the Small subunit (SSU) or Large subunit results in the final \code{TreeSummarizedExperiment} object.
#' Older pipeline versions do not report results for both subunits,
#' and thus for some accessions this value will have no effect.
#' @param get_tree Flag to control whether to include available phylogenetic trees in the TreeSummarizedExperiment object. At present this option is of limited use as
#' the trees available are specific to each accession, holding only a subset of the leaves and branches of the full canonical tree used for the pipeline. This means that
#' \code{TreeSummarizedExperiment} is unable to merge the trees, and therefore fails to build a final combined object. Setting \code{returnLists} to TRUE allows the results to be returned successfully,
#' albeit not in a single object.
#' @return Combined TreeSummarizedExperiment object with \code{row_data}, \code{col_data} and \code{assays} entries for all accessions.
